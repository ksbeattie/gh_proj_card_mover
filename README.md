# GitHub Project Card Mover
A script for automatically moving project cards from one project to another project.

Yes, I know about [PyGitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub), but it [doesn't currently support](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/606) the new [project API](https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/).

This is also an exercise on my part, as a first use us the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module and the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
